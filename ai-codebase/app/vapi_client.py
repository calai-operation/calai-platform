If ANY of these conditions is missing, the order is NOT completed.\n- Set order_status to 'abandoned' if: the call was disconnected or hung up before the customer confirmed the summary, the endedReason indicates an unexpected end (e.g. 'customer-ended-call' without confirmation, 'assistant-error', 'silence-timed-out'), the customer cancelled the order, the customer said 'no' to the order summary and never re-confirmed, or save_order was never successfully called.\n- Set order_status to 'in_progress' only if the call ended mid-conversation while items were actively being discussed but no summary was attempted.\n- Set customer_confirmed to true ONLY if the customer explicitly verbally confirmed the final order summary in the transcript with a clear 'yes', 'yeah', 'correct', 'that\\'s right' or similar. Simply saying 'that\\'s it' (meaning done adding items) does NOT count as confirming the summary. If the call ended before this confirmation, set customer_confirmed to false.\n- Set save_order_was_called to true ONLY if the transcript shows save_order was successfully invoked and the assistant confirmed the order. If save_order was never called, or was rejected by the backend, set it to false.\n\n**TOTAL PRICE RULES**:\n- For total_price, output the final total price clearly stated by the assistant to the customer. If no total was stated or confirmed in the transcript, set total_price to 0.\n- Do NOT guess or calculate a total that was never spoken in the conversation.\n\n**ITEM EXTRACTION**:\n- For each item in 'items', extract 'product_name', 'quantity' (as a string), and 'unit_prize' (the price of ONE unit as a decimal string, e.g. '22.09', '24.10', '5.83').\n- For unit_prize, use this priority order:\n  1. FIRST: Look for individual item prices spoken in the transcript (e.g. 'at eight pounds fifty each', 'at ten pounds'). Convert spoken prices to decimal strings (e.g. 'eight pounds fifty' = '8.50').\n  2. FALLBACK: If a specific item price was NOT spoken but the total_price and all quantities are known, calculate unit prices that sum to the stated total. Use common UK restaurant pricing (whole numbers or .50/.95/.99 endings).\n  3. NEVER output 'unknown', '0.0', or '0' for unit_prize. You MUST always provide a realistic numeric decimal string.\n\nThe delivery_type MUST be exactly 'pickup' or 'delivery'. If delivery_type is 'delivery', extract the 'delivery_address' from the transcript. If it's 'pickup', set 'delivery_address' to 'N/A' or an empty string.\n\nJson Schema:\n{{schema}}\n\nOnly respond with the JSON."
